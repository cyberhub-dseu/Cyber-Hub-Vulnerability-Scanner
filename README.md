# Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner (CHVS) Installation Guide

## Overview

This document will guide you through the installation of **Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner (CHVS)**, including the necessary dependencies and setup process. CHVS is a Python-based tool, and its functionality requires certain system dependencies like **Nmap** for network scanning.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing CHVS, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### 1. **Python 3.8+**
- CHVS requires Python version **3.8 or higher**. You can check your current Python version using the following command:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If your Python version is lower than 3.8, you will need to install or upgrade Python:
- **For Linux**: Use the package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3.8` for Ubuntu).
- **For macOS**: You can use `brew`:
  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```
- **For Windows**: Download and install from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. **Nmap**

Nmap is required for CHVS to perform network scanning. Install Nmap if it is not already installed:

- **For Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nmap
  ```
- **For macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install nmap
  ```
- **For Windows**: Download and install from [Nmap's official site](https://nmap.org/download.html).

Once installed, verify the installation by running:
```bash
nmap --version
```

### 3. **Git**
You will need **Git** to clone the repository. If Git is not installed, follow the instructions below:

- **For Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git
  ```
- **For macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```
- **For Windows**: Download and install from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the CHVS repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CyberHubVulnerabilityScanner.git
cd CyberHubVulnerabilityScanner
```

This will download all the necessary files to your local environment.

### 2. **Run the Installation Script**

CHVS includes an `install.py` script that handles the installation of required Python dependencies and checks if Nmap is installed.

Run the script:

```bash
python3 install.py
```

#### The script will:
- **Check for Python version** (must be 3.8 or higher).
- **Check if Nmap is installed** on your system and provide instructions if it's missing.
- **Install Python dependencies** (e.g., `requests`, `python-nmap`, etc.) using `pip`.

Example output:
```bash
Starting installation process for Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner...
Nmap is installed.
Installing dependencies from requirements.txt...
Dependencies installed successfully.
Installation complete! You can now use Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner.
```

## Manual Installation (Optional)

If you encounter issues with the installation script, you can manually install the dependencies:

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   Ensure you're in the project directory, then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Check Python Version**:
   Ensure your Python version is **3.8 or higher** by running:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

3. **Check Nmap Installation**:
   Ensure Nmap is installed by running:
   ```bash
   nmap --version
   ```

If everything is installed correctly, you're ready to use the Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner.

## Running CHVS

Once the installation is complete, you can start scanning web applications or networks using CHVS.

### Usage Syntax:
```bash
python3 -m chvs.core --target <target_host_or_IP> --mode <network|web> --output <json|html|csv>
```

### Parameters:
- `--target`: The IP address, domain, or URL you want to scan.
- `--mode`: Choose either `network` (for network scanning) or `web` (for web vulnerability scanning).
- `--output`: Specify the report format (choose between `json`, `html`, or `csv`).

### Examples:

#### 1. **Web Application Scan**:
Scan a website for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and more:
```bash
python3 -m chvs.core --target https://www.example.com --mode web --output csv
```

#### 2. **Network Scan**:
Scan a network for open ports and services:
```bash
python3 -m chvs.core --target 192.168.1.1 --mode network --output json
```

After the scan is complete, the results will be saved in the specified format (`csv`, `json`, or `html`) in the current working directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **Nmap Not Installed**:
If Nmap is not installed or is not detected, the script will prompt you with installation instructions based on your operating system.

Example error:
```bash
Error: Nmap is not installed. Please install Nmap before using this tool.
Instructions:
For Linux: sudo apt install nmap
For macOS: brew install nmap
For Windows: Download and install from https://nmap.org/download.html
```

### 2. **Dependency Installation Failed**:
If the installation of Python dependencies fails, check the following:
- Ensure you have an active internet connection.
- Ensure `pip` is installed. Run `pip --version` to verify.
- If using a virtual environment, ensure it is activated.

To manually install dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Invalid Python Version**:
If your Python version is below 3.8, the script will exit with the following error:
```bash
Error: CyberHubVulnerabilityScanner requires Python 3.8 or higher. Please upgrade your Python version.
```
Upgrade your Python version to proceed.

## Uninstalling CHVS

To uninstall CHVS, you can delete the cloned directory and optionally remove the installed Python dependencies:

1. Remove the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   rm -rf CyberHubVulnerabilityScanner
   ```

2. Optionally, you can uninstall the Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
   ```
