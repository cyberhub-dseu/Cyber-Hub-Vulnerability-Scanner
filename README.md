# Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner (CHVS)

## Overview

The **Cyber Hub Vulnerability Scanner (CHVS)** is an advanced security tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in both web applications and network services. It uses Nmap for network scanning and various techniques (like SQL Injection detection) to scan web applications for vulnerabilities.

This tool is intended for ethical hacking, pentesting, and educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission from the target before scanning.
